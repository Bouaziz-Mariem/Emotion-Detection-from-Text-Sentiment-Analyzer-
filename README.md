## Emotion Detection from Text (Sentiment Analyzer)
>>>>>>> e67f2d5 (project_2)

Type or paste any text, and the AI analyzes it for emotions (joy, anger, sadness, fear, surprise) using NLP techniques built from scratch — no pre-trained models.

**Features:**
- Emotion lexicon built from scratch using seed words + synonym expansion
- Multi-emotion detection (not just positive/negative — 6+ emotions)
- Sentence-level and word-level emotion highlighting
- Emotion intensity scoring (mild annoyance vs. rage)
- Visualization: emotion radar chart, emotion timeline for long texts
- Compare emotional tone across multiple texts (e.g., two book chapters)
